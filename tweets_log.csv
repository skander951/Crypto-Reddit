From Zcash to zk-proofs, from Tor to Tornado, from Cypherpunk roots to the Privacy District - every talk, every experiment has carried the same message:
privacy is not a feature, it is a human right woven into the protocol of freedom.

Ethereum was never meant to watch - it was meant to protect.
To build open systems that honor both transparency and dignity.

As the next generation gathers in Buenos Aires, the torch of Cypherpunk burns bright once more. 🔷✨

Waves lap on vast shores behind our open eyes
Children of our sun we devour their poignancies
Your deep look inside is a tether of light you gift
Our footprints semaphores we sandcastle desire.

Our music reminiscent of looks we once traded
Songs Johnny used to seduce us as night folded
Even our poetry still pins us back in days shared
Like songs we’ll never forget love was everything.

You always dance as if light couldn’t capture us
Between times I thought I just might touch yours
Even as we’ve found new lovers, you sing to me
Poetry once sealed in light can never fade, love.
